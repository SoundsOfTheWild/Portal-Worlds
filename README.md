# Portal-Worlds-
A game with smooth portals with potential for puzzle components.

Portals exists across 4 worlds with entrances and exits (exits cannot be traversed through), and the destination of portals can be set
by trigger events, such as a weighted pressure plate being depressed or a new area discovered. The portal teleportation is smooth and all 
shaders were coded by myself (including the simple screen space shader that allows the portals to be seen through)
